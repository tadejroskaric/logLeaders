# Log-leaders (master's thesis)

The files in this repository are the source code for a proposed clustering algorithm that I developed for my master's thesis in applied statistics. I called it the log-leaders method since it uses a log-likelihood-based distance and clusters on the idea of k-means. I also provided an example of usage.
